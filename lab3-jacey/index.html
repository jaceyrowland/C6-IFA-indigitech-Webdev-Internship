              Italy has more UNESCO World Heritage Sites than any other country
              in the world — over 50! It’s also the birthplace of espresso,
              pizza, and some of the world’s most influential art and
              architecture.

              Greece is one of the sunniest countries on earth, with over 250
              sunny days a year. It’s also home to one of the world’s oldest
              cities — Athens, inhabited for over 3,400 years.

              Salem is famous for the 1692 Witch Trials, but many historical
              sites there today are actually private homes still lived in —
              making it one of the most authentically preserved colonial towns
              in the U.S.

              London has over 170 museums, more than any other city in the world
              — including the British Museum, which has over 8 million objects.
              Also, Big Ben is not the tower — it’s the name of the bell inside
              the tower!

              The Eiffel Tower grows up to 6 inches taller in summer due to
              metal expansion. Paris is also known as the “City of Light” not
              just for its beauty — it was one of the first cities to adopt
              street lighting.
